# Medical-Image-Classfication

In a hope to further the implementation of Machine Learning in medical imaging. 
I am building a ML application that can process medical images (xrays) and learn
and identify various images from different reigions of the body and classify images 
based on finding and no finding classes.

This current implementation of of a Residual Neural Network currently classifies 
images of chest xrays into classes 'Effusion' and 'No Finding'
