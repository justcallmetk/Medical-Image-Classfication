# Abstract


I began this Project in a hope to further the applications of Machine Learning(ML) in medical imaging
while using blockchain technology to ensure security and the integrity of the results.

The convolutional neural network, also known as convert nets
or CNN's, is commonly used to identify patterns,
distinguish images, detect objects and recognize faces.


This current implementation of a CNN trains a tensorflow based CNN to detect
abnormalities in chest x rays. This ML model in its final form will be able to process 
medical images (xrays, ctscans , ekg etc.), train, learn, identify various images from different reigions 
of the body and classify images; give a diagnosis.

# Medical-Image-Classfication

classifies 
images of chest xrays into classes 'Effusion' and 'No Finding'
